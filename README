= Weibaseapp

This is the WEI base code for starting projects. Follow the getting started instructions below to create a new Rails project. Only commit changes back into this app when updating the base app, not when saving your project. 

== Getting Started

1. Clone the git WEI base app repository using

   `git clone git@github.com:wested/weibaseapp.git`  
    

2. You will want keep a link to this project as part of the git repository so you can easily fetch and merge enhancements and bug fixes of the base app into your project.

    `git remote add base git@github.com:wested/weibaseapp.git`
    
    In the future you can run the following command to receive updates:
        `git pull base`


3. Initialize the submodules and pull them into the project

    `git submodule init
   git submodule update`


4. Run all the normal commands when updating a project, such as:

    `rake gems:install, 
   rake db:migrate, 
   rake data:load:default:development`

5. Now you want to change where your origin points to; from the weibaseapp to your new_project.

    `vim .git/config`

    find the entry that looks like

    `[remote "origin"]  
  url = git@github.com:wested/weibaseapp.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*`

   and change it to


    `[remote "origin"]  
  url = git@github.com:wested/new_project.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*`  

    (be sure to replace new_project above with the name of your new project)

6. Finally after you have created the new project on github run

    `git push origin master`

7. Be sure to now follow the steps in the Workflow page (https://wiki.interactive.wested.org/mediawiki/index.php/Git_Workflow) to replace the master branch with an iteration branch.


== Configuring Hoptoad

After creating the project and configuring the repository, run the following snippet to generate the Hoptoad initializer and modify the deploy script. Double check the hoptoad_notifier page for current instructions (http://github.com/thoughtbot/hoptoad_notifier).
  ./script/generate hoptoad --api-key your_key_here
